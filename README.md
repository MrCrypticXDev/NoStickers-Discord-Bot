## About
The source code for the NoStickers bot that uses Discord.js. It also has an added-on customizable tweaks/configs for server admins. ðŸ‘€

NoStickers is a Discord bot that allows you to prevent or enable the usage of Discord's [sticker feature](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500008542422-Sticker-Updates-FAQ-Android-and-Desktop). Assuming your prefix is `!`, getting a list of commands can be done by running `!help`.

## Installation
**Prerequisites**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v14 or higher
* [NPM](https://npmjs.com)
* (Optional) A [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) account
* (Optional) [Git](https://git-scm.org)

**Setup**

Firstly, you need to have a local copy of this repository on your code editor, you may either:
1. Clone this repository via `git clone https://github.com/MrCrypticXDev/NoStickers-Discord-Bot.git`. Note that if needed, you'll have to `cd` to the directory the files are in.
2. Copy the contents of this repository.

So now you have a copy, follow the steps below:
1. You may optionally configure the [package](package.json) file to your needs. Or create your own by running `npm init`.
2. Run `npm install` to get the dependencies and devDependencies.
3. In the [config](src/config.json) file, set the following variables with the necessary values:
* `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN` refers to the token retrieved from the bot page of your app in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). Need [help](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token)? Note that it's recommended to use [`.env`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41501273) files instead of hard coding the token.
* `YOUR_USER_ID` refers to your user ID on Discord. There's an [article](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) for that.
* `YOUR_BOT_PREFIX` refers to the character your bot will detect for, so that it knows when to respond to a command. For example, `!`.
* `YOUR_MONGODB_URL` refers to the URL of your MongoDB cluster.
* `YOUR_APP_PUBLIC_KEY` refers to the public key retrieved from your app in the developer portal. This appears in the general page, just below the app ID.
4. Run `node src/index.js` to start the bot. Don't forget to invite it!
5. And lastly, **enjoy Stickers while you can.** ðŸŒº

## Additional information
* You may run `npm run lint` to find errors in your code. There's also `npm run lint:fix` that has the ability to correct certain types of mistakes.
* Written in the JavaScript language, runs on the Node.js runtime environment, and uses Discord.js as the core library.
* Chalk is used for logging, whilst mongoose is for using MongoDB. ESLint is for code linting.
