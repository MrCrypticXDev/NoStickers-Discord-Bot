# NoStickers-Discord-Bot
The Source Code for NoStickers bot written in Discord.js also added on customizable tweaks/configs for server admins. ðŸ‘€
So first you have to install the packages but first `npm init -y` then `npm install` then add your bot token in the *config.json* file at the "token" field after which you'll add your MongoDB URL. **Enjoy Stickers while you can.** ðŸŒº
